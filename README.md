# Zillow_HobokenJerseyCity_Price_Estimator

The following was a final project for EE-551 Engineering Programming: Python. I decided to create a House Price Estimator using python and machine learning knowledge to create a proof of concept way of web scraping data off of zillow and creating an algorithm to help predict home prices. While the algorithm is not accurate in the end, the project does effectively show a good starting point for others to continue to improve the algorithm and add extra features to base price off of. As this project was done for the university of Stevens Institute of Technology, the house predictor works with data from Jersey City and Hoboken to be more relevant to expected readers.
